				<h1>About</h1>
				<p>Currently, I am an undergraduate mechanical engineering student
				at Columbia University's School of Engineering and Applied Science
				(SEAS). Before studying at Columbia, I majored in physics at the 
				College of the Holy Cross and was a part of the 3-2 engineering 
				program. The 3-2 engineering program at Holy Cross allowed me 
				to complete my physics major in 3 years, and then transfer to Columbia
				to study engineering for 2 years. This program allows me to combine
				a liberal arts education from Holy Cross with rigorous technical learning
				from Columbia.</p>			
				<br />
				
				<h1>Holy Cross—Liberal Arts</h1>
				<p>Holy Cross is a four-year Jesuit liberal arts college. As a first-year student
				at Holy Cross, I played the alto saxophone for the Goodtime Marching
				Band. In the spring, I shifted to performing for the Crusader Pep Band. In my sophomore year, I tutored at the 
				Nativity School of Worcester in math, science, and other subjects as
				part of the Student Programs for Urban Development. Tutoring at 
				Nativity was a memorable service experience, where I valued motivating
				and encouraging others to try their best.</p>
				<br />
				
				<p>I performed research at Holy Cross; my first project was to engineer 
				a datalogging device that would synchronize data collected by a 
				telescope array. This device used an Arduino microcontroller to replace
				an old Basic STAMP microcontroller for improved speed and reliability.
				See my <a href="Portfolio.html">portfolio</a> for more details on this
				technology. Later, I worked
				on simulating the viewing solid angle of the telescopes in the array. 
				Finally, I modeled the diurnal variance in detected muon flux and 
				determined whether the telescopes performed inconsistently. I modeled
				the diurnal variance using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). I created
				data processing software using Python and then improved it so that
				modeling occurred automatically after data processing. This research
				was a formative experience operating primitive technology with real-time
				data analysis and hardware adjustment.</p>
				<br />
				
				<h1>Columbia Engineering</h1>
				<p>This fall, I anticipate joining the Columbia Space Initiative (CSI) and
				Engineers Without Borders (EWB).  I believe initiatives such as CSI
				characterize the progress that engineers dream of achieving when 
				helping communities; I believe in the prospect of service through 
				engineering.  As problem solvers, engineers have the tools necessary
				to make an impact on communities that need help. Our goal is to 
				work together to innovate lasting solutions that make our communities
				better places for everyone. I look forward to having the opportunity
				to serve communities from other nations who need help through EWB.</p>
