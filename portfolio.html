				<h1>GitHub Programs</h1>
				<p>I have released some of my past research work
				<a href="https://github.com/AlexLMurphy/TelescopePrograms">here on GitHub.</a>
				These programs were used at the College of the Holy Cross for astrophysics 
				research with a cosmic ray scintillation detector telescope array.

				<p>My Arduino code on GitHub is for a utilitarian datalogging device made
				from the Arduino Leonardo, an SD shield, and a GPS shield shown to the right. 
				To briefly describe	this datalogging device, it is part of a non-paralyzable 
				detector capable of automatically recording electronic events with a short
				10ms dead time. The device has a GPS and crystal oscillator in order
				to asses the precise UTC time at which an event occurred.
				Thus, data collected from multiple detectors can be analyzed to
				determine which detections from those detectors were simultaneous 
				and coincident.
				<!-- I constructed this with an Arduino for low power consumption. -->
				</p>
				<br />
				
				
				<p>The GitHub Python code performs modeling of the data collected by the Arduino.
				Tailored for events that occur randomly at a fixed true rate,
				the Python program interprets both hexadecimal timestamps created by 
				the Arduino and parses NMEA strings collected from the GPS. 
				The Python program may be less useful to the public. It serves a very 
				specific purpose.
				</p>
