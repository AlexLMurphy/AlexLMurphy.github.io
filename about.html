				<h1>Holy Cross—Liberal Arts</h1>
				<p>Currently, I am an undergraduate physics student
				at the College of the Holy Cross. Holy Cross is a four-year 
				Jesuit liberal arts college. As a first-year student
				at Holy Cross, I played the alto saxophone for the Goodtime Marching
				Band. In the spring, I shifted to performing for the Crusader Pep Band.
				In my sophomore year, I tutored at the 
				Nativity School of Worcester in math, science, and other subjects as
				part of the Student Programs for Urban Development. Tutoring at 
				Nativity was a memorable service experience, where I valued motivating
				and encouraging others to try their best.</p>
				<br />
				
				<p>I performed research at Holy Cross; my first project was to engineer 
				a datalogging device that would synchronize data collected by a 
				telescope array. This device used an Arduino microcontroller to replace
				an old Basic STAMP microcontroller for improved speed and reliability.
				See my <a href="portfolio.html">portfolio</a> for more details on this
				technology. Later, I worked
				on simulating the viewing solid angle of the telescopes in the array. 
				Finally, I modeled the diurnal variance in detected muon flux and 
				determined whether the telescopes performed inconsistently. I modeled
				the diurnal variance using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). I created
				data processing software using Python and then improved it so that
				modeling occurred automatically after data processing. This research
				was a formative experience operating primitive technology with real-time
				data analysis and hardware adjustment.</p>
